# Feedback

Feedback is more than welcome, however, there are a couple of things to keep in mind before you fire off your message.

If you have a request for information about a specific post, please use the “Comments” link on that post.
You must use a valid email address or your message will be discarded and will never be seen by anyone.
If applicable, tell me what version of MDaemon you’re using.
Messages may be published, or answered in the form of a future blog article. Personal details will not be shared.
I don’t provide formal MDaemon technical support.
The older your version of MDaemon, the less interested I am going to be in your issue.
